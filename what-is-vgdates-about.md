# What is VGDates about?

I was recently wondering what games were coming up and it can be an annoying process!

Specifically, I wished the sites were

- Single serving
  - In the case of game journalism sites, release dates took the form of a wiki site or a blog post which wasn't the most efficient layout
  - More "traditional" sites like Metacritic could take a lot of clicking to get the information I wanted. They primarily served other functions and keeping upcoming titles updated wasn't their focus
- Easy to parse both visually and technically
  - There's a number of lists that may be hugely comprehensive, like Giant Bomb, but there's almost too much data. It's hard to just glimpse at the information and be done.
  - While Giant Bomb has an API, other sites just serve up plain HTML which can be a pain in the ass for requesting that data for other uses
- Up to date
  - Giant Bomb is great for this sorta stuff
  - Wiki/blog post sites can take a long time to get updated with new titles.
  -Publishers may push back dates or outright cancel games leading to confusion as to what dates are correct!

I had felt like this for a long time but finally got around to forming my own answer to this problem recently.

Version 1 was just meant to be a simple side project but I started to use the development version often and kept adding to it. The bulk of the initial work was done while I was searching for my first development job and I learnt quite a bit along the way.

The original version of the project stalled once I picked up a full time contact but said contact has given me a bunch more experience to make an even better version of VGDates that both I, and hopefully you, will enjoy and find useful.
